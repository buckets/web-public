Just wanted to post a general update about what&amp;rsquo;s going on with Buckets: mobile app progress, Buckets Beta and the future roadmap.
Mobile apps I work on the mobile app (and corresponding desktop app changes) nearly every day. Progress is slow but steady. But because of the all mobile app work, some desktop bugs have languished a bit. So I&amp;rsquo;m hoping soon to pause mobile development for a few bug-fixing releases.</description></item><item><title>Price Increase in March</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve analyzed last year&amp;rsquo;s community survey and Buckets' worth and costs. As a result, in the beginning of March 2019 Buckets will cost $49.
Everything else about the license will be the same, including the untimed trial. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased (or purchase before the price increase) you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay anything to continue using Buckets.
We were hoping this price change would coincide with the release of the mobile apps, but they still aren&amp;rsquo;t ready yet.</description></item><item><title>Making a Cross-Platform App in 2018</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/13/making-an-app-2018.html/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/13/making-an-app-2018.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>What does it take to make a cross platform (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android and iOS) application in 2018?

This version includes a few long-awaited changes. Parts of the UI have been cleaned up, and a few new features are available for those who manually enter transactions.
Cleaner Buckets tab The Buckets tab can breathe again!
There are fewer vertical lines.
Each bucket balance is now the first column after the name so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how much you have in each bucket at a glance.</description></item><item><title>Sometimes You Shouldn't Store Timestamps in UTC</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/03/14/always-store-utc.md.html/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/03/14/always-store-utc.md.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="./clocks.jpg" alt="Clocks">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bug turned up in Buckets after this Daylight Saving weekend, and while fixing it, I realized that it was a mistake to store some particular timestamps in UTC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Over 50 Improvements in the Last Month</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/02/23/v34-lots-of-newstuff.html/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/02/23/v34-lots-of-newstuff.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last month, Buckets has become even better at helping you manage your money well. Here&amp;rsquo;s a highlight of the best new features and fixes.&lt;/p>

To add income, either click the big - button to the left of the input or else prefix the amount with +.</description></item><item><title>Buckets</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/buckets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 22:41:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/buckets/</guid><description>After entering our accounts, we clicked on the Buckets tab to divide up our money into useful categories—buckets. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to think of buckets as literal buckets, filled with money, sitting around your house (or pretend they&amp;rsquo;re envelopes, if you prefer).
We make a bucket for every independent expense or goal. We currently have 63 buckets, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t start with that many. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel pressured to make a bunch.</description></item><item><title>Accounts</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/accounts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 22:15:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/accounts/</guid><description>The very first thing we did when setting up our budget was to enter all our bank account names and balances in the Accounts tab.
Each account has a detailed view that you can get to by clicking more.
Naming accounts To name/rename an account, click on it&amp;rsquo;s name in the table (or in the detailed view) and type in the new name.
Balance In the account&amp;rsquo;s detailed view, change the balance by updating the value in the balance text box.</description></item><item><title>Categorizing</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/categorizing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 15:35:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/categorizing/</guid><description>Every real life transaction for your accounts should cause a corresponding transaction in one or more Buckets. So if you charged $1 to your credit card to buy a doughnut, you should take $1 out of your Doughnut bucket.
Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one already, perhaps you should make a Doughnut bucket :)
Categorizing happens in the Transactions tab.
Simple categorizing Click Categorize on a transaction Choose a bucket from the dropdown menu.</description></item><item><title>Debt</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/debt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 15:35:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/debt/</guid><description>If you are trying to pay off debt, there are a few things Buckets can offer you.
Mortgage/Loan Many users treat fixed-payment credit (e.g. mortgages and car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget. It makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as Off Budget rather than Debt.
Credit Cards and Other Debt If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a Normal account.</description></item><item><title>New: Amazon Reconciliation</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/17/amazon.html/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/17/amazon.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever been frustrated by how Amazon splits up purchases?

You don't need this if you just want to use the Buckets app. Buckets budget files are SQLite databases. The schema is mostly self-explanatory, but this document points out some things that aren&amp;rsquo;t.
WARNING: The schema is not final and may change without warning in future versions of Buckets.

I don&amp;rsquo;t even consider it an invented thing. It just seems like a logical thing to do with money. You could do this with physical envelopes or the Buckets app.
Steps In essence, you do this every month:

How to do each of these is explored in more detail in other pages in this guide.
1. Give generously Your life will be better when you give some amount of money away. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be much, but build charitable giving into your budget.
2. Live on last month&amp;rsquo;s income Spend this month what you earned last month. If you&amp;rsquo;re not able to do it yet, make it a goal.</description></item><item><title>Buckets is 50% Off until Jan 10th</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/02/happynewyear.html/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/02/happynewyear.html/</guid><description>Happy New Year!
New years are like blank books, for which you are the author. With just an old-fashioned fountain pen. Hey, your book&amp;rsquo;s binding is cracked. Maybe go get some tape or glue before you start writing? Also, you are hungry. Better eat lunch first.
Good luck this year&amp;hellip;
(at least you can count on your budget going well)
