&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Budgets from different devices can now be merged together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can now share budgets using a shared network folder&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Buckets is one step closer to working seamlessly on mobile!&lt;/p>

I don’t like to pick on other apps, because honestly, if it works for you that’s great! I’m happy when people are financially successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Buckets is unique in a few ways that I’d like to highlight. And most of these have very little to do with budgeting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This release includes a lot of internal changes (updating of software libraries and tools) that were needed to finally support Apple Silicon machines. In addition, Buckets is now also built for Linux ARM64 machines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>AND, there&amp;rsquo;s a new report under Analysis!

As a kid, I would buy things here and there and occasionally splurge on something I really wanted (I still remember shelling out for Space Quest 5), but most of my money went to the bank.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good budgeting meant saving everything. At least in my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think like I did, that budgeting means &lt;strong>never spending money&lt;/strong>, this post is for you. If you&amp;rsquo;re a spendthrift, skip this one :)&lt;/p>

That&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s no save button. Currently, the only exception to this is when recording macros (because updating macros must be explicitly saved).
Calculators Everywhere! Somewhat like a spreadsheet, every field in Buckets where you type in numbers is a calculator. For instance, you can type 2+2 or 35/12:
Notes Accounts, transactions, buckets and bucket groups can all have searchable notes attached to them.</description></item><item><title>Multiple windows</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2020/05/21/duplicate-windows.html/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2020/05/21/duplicate-windows.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a short post, but I wanted to highlight one of my favorite, simple features in &lt;a href="https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com">Buckets&lt;/a>—multiple windows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buckets 0.56: Sharing Edition</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2020/04/20/apr2020-update.html/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2020/04/20/apr2020-update.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve just released Buckets Beta v0.56.0!

Just wanted to post a general update about what&amp;rsquo;s going on with Buckets: mobile app progress, Buckets Beta and the future roadmap.
Mobile apps I work on the mobile app (and corresponding desktop app changes) nearly every day. Progress is slow but steady. But because of the all mobile app work, some desktop bugs have languished a bit. So I&amp;rsquo;m hoping soon to pause mobile development for a few bug-fixing releases.</description></item><item><title>Price Increase in March</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve analyzed [last year&amp;rsquo;s community survey]({{ relref &amp;ldquo;../2018-12-04-survey2018results/index.md&amp;rdquo; }}) and Buckets' worth and costs. As a result, in the beginning of March 2019 Buckets will cost $49.
Everything else about the license will be the same, including the untimed trial. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased (or purchase before the price increase) you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay anything to continue using Buckets.
We were hoping this price change would coincide with the release of the mobile apps, but they still aren&amp;rsquo;t ready yet.</description></item><item><title>Making a Cross-Platform App in 2018</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/13/making-an-app-2018.html/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/13/making-an-app-2018.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>What does it take to make a cross platform (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android and iOS) application in 2018?

It&amp;rsquo;s useful to think of buckets as literal buckets, filled with money, sitting around your house (or pretend they&amp;rsquo;re envelopes, if you prefer).
We make a bucket for every independent expense or goal. We currently have 63 buckets, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t start with that many.

Each account has a detailed view that you can get to by clicking more.
Naming accounts To name/rename an account, click on it&amp;rsquo;s name in the table (or in the detailed view) and type in the new name.
Balance In the account&amp;rsquo;s detailed view, change the balance by updating the value in the balance text box.</description></item><item><title>Categorizing</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/categorizing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 15:35:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/app/categorizing/</guid><description>Every real life transaction for your accounts should cause a corresponding transaction in one or more Buckets. So if you charged $1 to your credit card to buy a doughnut, you should take $1 out of your Doughnut bucket.
Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one already, perhaps you should make a Doughnut bucket :)
Categorizing happens in the Transactions tab.

Mortgage/Loan Many users treat fixed-payment credit (e.g. mortgages and car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget. It makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as Off Budget rather than Debt.
Credit Cards and Other Debt If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a Normal account.</description></item><item><title>New: Amazon Reconciliation</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/17/amazon.html/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/17/amazon.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever been frustrated by how Amazon splits up purchases?

You could do this with physical envelopes or the Buckets app.
Imagine you have a rain barrel catching all your income that you then divvy out to fill up smaller buckets. Each bucket is different and the fill line varies. You want to make a bucket for all of the expenses you have.</description></item><item><title>Principles</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/getting-started/1-principles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/guide/getting-started/1-principles/</guid><description>Here are some guiding principles to help you budget well. If you want to jump into how to set up your budget, jump to Buckets Method.
1. Live on last month&amp;rsquo;s income Spend this month what you earned last month. If you&amp;rsquo;re not able to do it yet, make it a goal. You really can do it—Buckets can help you!
When you start living on a month&amp;rsquo;s supply of income, start saving to have a &amp;ldquo;spare month&amp;rsquo;s supply&amp;rdquo; of income.</description></item><item><title>Buckets is 50% Off until Jan 10th</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/02/happynewyear.html/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/01/02/happynewyear.html/</guid><description>Happy New Year!
New years are like blank books, for which you are the author. With just an old-fashioned fountain pen. Hey, your book&amp;rsquo;s binding is cracked. Maybe go get some tape or glue before you start writing? Also, you are hungry. Better eat lunch first.
Good luck this year&amp;hellip;

Buckets makes a great gift! And instead of $40 it&amp;rsquo;s now $29.95. AND if you buy before the new year it&amp;rsquo;s 50% off ($15).
Also there&amp;rsquo;s a new home for Buckets. Instead of the mouthful bucketsisbetter.com remember to BudgetWithBuckets.com
