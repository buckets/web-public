We have created this Privacy Policy to tell you what information the App collects, how we use that information, and who we will share that information with, if at all. This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy practices of any third parties that we do not own, control, or are affiliated with. By visiting and/or using our App, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the terms of the accompanying Software Application End User License Agreement. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use the information it contains to help you make informed decisions.</p>

<p>We do not collect any &ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo; such as your email, name, phone number or mailing address, from you when you download and use the App <strong>unless</strong> you provide us with such information voluntarily. In the course of operating the App, you authorize us to collect and/or receive a minimal amount of information from you as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Download of the App.</strong> Upon downloading a Trial Version of the App, there is NO information we receive or collect from you!</li>

This Payment Information will be collected and processed by our third-party payment vendors pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use. We do not obtain access to any of your payment information in connection with such purchases or subscriptions.</li>
<li><strong>User Contacts Us.</strong> If you need assistance with the App and you voluntarily contact us, we may require you to submit your name, email address, and a physical address.

You consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</li>
