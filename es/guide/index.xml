You don't need this if you just want to use the Buckets app. Buckets budget files are SQLite databases. The schema is mostly self-explanatory, but this document points out some things that aren&amp;rsquo;t.
WARNING: The schema is not final and may change without warning in future versions of Buckets. If you still have questions after reading this, feel free to chat with me.</description></item></channel></rss>
