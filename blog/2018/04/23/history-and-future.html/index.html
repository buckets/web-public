<article class=post-content>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stated that Buckets is a &ldquo;keep-going&rdquo; (not a start-up). Let me explain.</p>
<p><img src=./hero.jpg alt="map and compass"></p>
<h2 id=in-summary>In summary<a class=anchor-link href=#in-summary>&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>We</em> use Buckets. We want it to stick around.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a budgeting nerd.</li>
<li>I enjoy budgeting and working on Buckets.</li>
<li>I get tremendous satisfaction knowing that people find it useful.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still enthusiastic about the work even after having worked on it for 7 years.</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m ever unable or unwilling to continue, my first choice is to make Buckets open source.</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;margin-top:2rem><svg viewBox="0 0 600 15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="max-width:800px"><rect x="20%" y="7" width="60%" height="1" fill="lightgrey" rx="2"/><rect class="rotate" x="50%" y="4" width="7" height="7" fill="#fff" stroke="lightgrey" stroke-width="1" rx="1"/></svg>
</div>
<h2 id=history>History<a class=anchor-link href=#history>&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id=early-years---php-and-mysql>Early years - PHP and MySQL<a class=anchor-link href=#early-years---php-and-mysql>&para;</a></h3>
<p>The bank was the closest business to my house growing up. I visited it a lot. In 7th grade, I asked my mom about T-Bills, CDs and stocks and she helped me get an appointment with someone at the bank to tell me about them. The surprised man said that he wished <em>he</em> had been interested in investing when he was my age. I thought it was weird that other kids weren&rsquo;t interested. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want free money?</p>
<p>As a teenager, I started buying CDs (I still remember that amazing 7%, 2-year CD!). And suddenly, I didn&rsquo;t just have a single bank account any more. I needed something to help me manage my combined accounts and categorize them. So I grabbed some PHP and MySQL and made the first incarnation of Buckets. It was no-frills and perfect.</p>
<h3 id=africa>Africa<a class=anchor-link href=#africa>&para;</a></h3>
<p>At 19, I served for two years <a href=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program>as a missionary</a> in southern Africa. I learned firsthand that money does not bring happiness. If anything, it feels like the inverse is true. There are extremes, for sure, but more money isn&rsquo;t the basis for a happy life. I&rsquo;m grateful to have learned that lesson (though it sure is hard to believe sometimes).</p>
<h3 id=college---spreadsheet>College - Spreadsheet<a class=anchor-link href=#college---spreadsheet>&para;</a></h3>
<p>Once in college, without a computer of my own, I built a budget tracker in Google Sheets. It met my needs and was extensible enough to allow for any kind of crazy thing I wanted to do. It worked great&mldr; until I met a cute girl and married her.</p>
<h3 id=marriage>Marriage<a class=anchor-link href=#marriage>&para;</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, my home-grown spreadsheet wasn&rsquo;t cutting it. My wife and I were determined to be united in our finances. We looked at several applications, but most were either too accounting-y, too simplistic, too invasive, or not cross-platform. (It&rsquo;s here that I must admit that I did, in fact, convince my wife to use Linux as our first desktop OS. I liked it. And we&rsquo;ll leave it at that).</p>
<p>So we started with a spreadsheet and spent 2 or more hours every month updating it. It was painful. It was often confusing. <em>There must be a better way!</em></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the first version of Buckets was born: a web application first hosted locally, then eventually opened up for others to use. It was perfect for us.</p>
<p>But no one bought it (except kind friends). Thanks, friends. However, even though no one else liked it, I <em>still</em> enjoyed working on it.</p>
<h3 id=desktop>Desktop<a class=anchor-link href=#desktop>&para;</a></h3>
<p>Then, in August 2017 I ported the web app to a desktop app and we tried it for our budget that month. We knew immediately that the desktop was where Buckets belongs. So in October 2017, the first cross-platform, desktop version of Buckets came out.</p>
<p>People like it. In fact, complete strangers have paid for it.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;margin-top:2rem><svg viewBox="0 0 600 15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="max-width:800px"><rect x="20%" y="7" width="60%" height="1" fill="lightgrey" rx="2"/><rect class="rotate" x="50%" y="4" width="7" height="7" fill="#fff" stroke="lightgrey" stroke-width="1" rx="1"/></svg>
</div>
<h2 id=future>Future<a class=anchor-link href=#future>&para;</a></h2>
<p>I enjoy working on Buckets, and foresee working on it for many years to come. Will Buckets make me a millionaire? Nope, probably not—at least I don&rsquo;t expect it to.</p>
<p>Where does Buckets go from here? Here&rsquo;s a high-level road map (subject to change and missing lots of detail, of course):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix every reported bug</li>
<li>Off budget accounting (net wealth, etc&mldr;)</li>
<li>Debt management</li>
<li>Mobile companion app (won&rsquo;t have all the features of desktop)</li>
<li>Full documentation</li>
<li>Partial categorization</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Improve bank macros</li>
<li>Code sign the application</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to get to the mobile app before the end of 2018.</p>
<p>— Matt</p>

<div class=message>Any update on the mobile apps? Asking because that is the only thing preventing me to switch to buckets. I’m on the go most of the time, and don’t use a comouter often. So a phone app (to at least add transactions) would be awesome!</div>

<div class=message>New to Buckets - making the switch from YNAB-4. Is there a way to schedule recurring transactions such as weekly pay (deposit), monthly mortgage (withdrawal), etc. so they don' have to be manually entered every month and to allow planning ahead?</div>

<div class=message>Hi Matt,
your application looks nice - I just imported everything from YNAB4 :)
It worked ok in general, with just a few issues:
-All transfers were "uncategorized" and I had to manually set them up as "transfer".
-A few split transactions got lost. I think it was related to moving money between buckets in YNAB by having a split transaction outgoing from bucket A, incoming to bucket B. (Which is not how it should be done anyway)
Feedback:
-I'm missing the "Payee" column, which auto-filled the category/bucket. Not a big deal I guess, since it was mostly for analysis / searching.
-"Search" seems to ignore the amount column? (Workaround is using CTRL+F inside transaction view, but this only works month-by-month
My biggest issue right now is the same as TR postet:
-I cannot shedule recurring transactions. This was really helpful as a reminder, and not having to write everything again manually each month / 3 month / year.
Greetings,
Frostregen</div>

YNAB might be helping you out here. Their recent pricing increase is sending people running. I'll happily send you some coin once I have a chance to check out Buckets.</div>

<div class=message>Hey Matt, thanks for this great tool. I've yet to use it (just downloaded it) so I'll see how it works out from here but I was wondering what differences there would be between the trial version vs. the paid one. Is it the update/support? Certain functionalities?
Thanks!</div>

<div class=message>Hey David,
The trial version is limited in the following ways:
1. There's a yellow "Trial Version" sticker in the bottom corner of the Buckets window.
2. After a while, it will prompt you to purchase on startup (but if you need more time to try it out, you can dismiss it)
3. Every budget includes a bucket to help you save for a license.
Other than that, it's the same. Take it for a spin!</div>

<div class=message>Here from the potential YNAB exodus, I don't see a mention of off-budget accounting in the docs yet, is that already available? I could make it work without (just make a fake Net Worth bucket), but it'd be awesome if that was already a thing.</div>

<div class=message>Beamer has point. Not sure how many you'll get but seems possible to look for YNAB off-ramp here as well. I don't know if you look for inspiration elsewhere but they have a good system. I saw the YNAB4 import.
Track income - put that in categories(buckets)
As expenses occur for particular Category/Credit Card, move the money from the transaction's Category-Available to the Credit Card-Payment.
Reconcile Accounts to make sure all of your available funds are accounted for(every dollar a job.)
Wishing you well either way.</div>

<div class=message>Submitted for your alpha test of the app. Can't wait to try it out! My wife doesn't like to sit down at the desktop, so our budget isn't keeping up with reality as much as it should. The app will be a great help. We are also from the YNAB Exodus. Been using Buckets for a few months now, and I bought a license after reading abouy your loaves initiative. May God be glorified! Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</div>
