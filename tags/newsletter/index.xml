Paying so much for an application that&amp;rsquo;s designed to help you &lt;em>save&lt;/em> money doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce a small experiment we&amp;rsquo;ll be running over the next few months: Buckets by the Loaf.&lt;/p>

Just wanted to post a general update about what&amp;rsquo;s going on with Buckets: mobile app progress, Buckets Beta and the future roadmap.
Mobile apps I work on the mobile app (and corresponding desktop app changes) nearly every day. Progress is slow but steady. But because of the all mobile app work, some desktop bugs have languished a bit. So I&amp;rsquo;m hoping soon to pause mobile development for a few bug-fixing releases.</description></item><item><title>Price Increase in March</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2019/01/19/priceup.html/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve analyzed last year&amp;rsquo;s community survey and Buckets' worth and costs. As a result, in the beginning of March 2019 Buckets will cost $49.
Everything else about the license will be the same, including the untimed trial. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased (or purchase before the price increase) you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay anything to continue using Buckets.
We were hoping this price change would coincide with the release of the mobile apps, but they still aren&amp;rsquo;t ready yet.</description></item><item><title>2018 Survey Results</title><link>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/04/survey2018results.html/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/blog/2018/12/04/survey2018results.html/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thank you to everyone who filled out the first annual Buckets Community Survey!
